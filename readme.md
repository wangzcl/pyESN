# Echo State Network for Weather Forecast

A Python implementation of Echo State Network (Reservoir Computers).

The specification of the network mainly follows [Lu *et al* (2017)](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4979665), while the leakage rate is fixed to be zero. See [Mitsui *et al* (2021)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac0acb) for an example of its utilization.

This project is inspired by [Clemens Kornd√∂rfer's code](https://github.com/cknd/pyESN).
